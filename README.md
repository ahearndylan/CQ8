# CQ8

Staircase: There are two loops within this code. This means that for the outer loop, it will run n times for the height of the staircase. The inner loop will also run n times for each iteration of the outer loop. This leads to a time complexity of O(N^2). This algorithm uses a constant amount of space, meaning the memory will not change for various values of n. This leads to a space complexity of O(1).
